# Wordcloud app for the Mason Farm Butterfly Project

## Note: We haven't published our dataset yet, so for now you can see the app live on the project's [website](https://ncbutterflies.web.unc.edu/what-is-flying/) or on my [shinyapps.io account](https://kaugustine.shinyapps.io/wordcloud/).

#### This is an R Shiny app that uses the wordcloud package to display butterfly species by the number of individuals observed per month at Mason Farm Biological Reserve in Chapel Hill, NC. It displays both a wordcloud and list for common species as well as uncommon species. This is still a work in progress, but it's been a fun project that I wanted to share and document here for my research lab. I will update this code as I make changes.
